!!! gel-attention "Alpha Stage"

    Please be aware that this package and the underlying CGP APIs are currently in the **Alpha** phase of development. This means:

    * APIs are subject to potential breaking changes.
    * No Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are offered at this stage.

    We plan to transition to a private **Beta** phase in the second quarter of 2025, where we will begin testing with realistic data, moving beyond the current test data.
