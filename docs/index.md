### Python client for the Clinical Genomics Platform APIs

The [**CGP Client**](https://github.com/NHS-NGS/cgpclient) is a Python library designed to simplify and accelerate your interactions with the Clinical Genomics Platform (CGP) APIs on the [NHS API Platform](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/api-platform).

!!! gel-attention "Alpha Stage"

    Please be aware that this package and the underlying CGP APIs are currently in the **Alpha** phase of development. This means:

    * APIs are subject to potential breaking changes.
    * No Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are offered at this stage.

    We plan to transition to a private **Beta** phase in the near future, where we will begin testing with realistic data, moving beyond the current test data.
